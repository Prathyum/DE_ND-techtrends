# DE_ND-techtrends

TechTrends is an online website used as a news sharing platform, that enables consumers to access the latest news within the cloud-native ecosystem. 
In addition to accessing the available articles, readers are able to create new media articles and share them with the wider community. In this project, as a platform engineer, the main role is to package and deploy the application to a Kubernetes platform. 
Throughout this project, Docker has been used to package the application, and automated the Continuous Integration process with GitHub Actions. For the release process, Kubernetes declarative manifests was used, which were templated using Helm. 
To automate the Continuous Delivery process, ArgoCD was used.
